# Remote-Control-Network-Research
A basic script that uses remote server to check whois and open ports and log the result  

What the script do:  
Install needed application and not installing the already installed application  
Check if network connection is anonymous, if not, alert user and exit  
If connection is anonymous, display the spoofed country name  
Allow user to specify the domain/IP address  
Display the details of remote server (country, IP, uptime)  
Get remote server to check whois and open ports (via nmap) and log it into local computer
